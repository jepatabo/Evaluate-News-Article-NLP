# Project Title

Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

## Project Motivation

The motive of this project is to have you a taste of the environment and tools you will most likely come across in a front end role. Your focus should be to understand the role every tool and technology is playing in the overall architecture. You shouldnâ€™t feel the need to memorize the particular commands, config setups, or structure that we create here. Every project in the industry will have its own custom setup, but if you understand the moving pieces, you will be able to get the gist of even far more complicated projects than this one.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

## Natural Language Processing

NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve. Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition, but I found it to be a clear one:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
> concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
> process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## Project Stages

The stages of this project are:

- Getting Started - Setting up the Project
- Setting up the API
- Project Enhancement
- Unit Testing using Jest Framework
- Service Workers

## Project Description

This project required me to implement an NLP API into a web application, using the following API<a href="https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis">Meaning Cloud API</a>.

## How to Run the App

- run npm run build
- npm run start to start the server
- npm run dev to run the client
- input a URL and results will disply (agreement, subjectivity, Confidence, Irony and Score Tag)
